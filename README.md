# ISawedThisPlayerInHalf!
Your player... is ca- oh my god, his torso is flying!

This mod splits apart the player, freeing the torso from the legs.

  
## How to Use
These chat commands allow you to control your offsets, the new position of the torso, in-game.

* Help: **::offsets help**
* Set offsets: **::offsets set \<x> \<y> \<z>**
* Reset offsets: **::offsets reset**
* Print out offsets (defaults to self): **::offsets get [player name]**

::ofs can be used in place of ::offsets.

Offsets can also be modified using the config file (in config/isawedthisplayerinhalf-client.toml)


## Multiplayer
The mod must also be on the server for multiplayer-compatibility.

I would **_not_** recommend using this on a server that does not have the mod.
